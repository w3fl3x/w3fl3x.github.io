            <p>My name is Huy Nguyen. I graduated from University of Washington with a Bachelor of Chemistry and now I am currently enrolled in UW Coding Bootcamp. What I am most excited about this class is to challenge myself to learn new coding skills and to use what I learn to get a job in the tech industry.</p>
        
            <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing tennis and drawing. I do not get to play tennis much anymore as I injured my wrist and still waiting for it to fully heal. It will be nice to be able to play tennis without pain when my wrist is fully healed.</p>
        
            <p>My other passion is anything car related. I enjoy changing each parts with something that is better to improve on what came from the factory, from the visual of the car to improving on the overall performance. It's a challenge to find the right combination of parts to make the improvement all while still keeping the overall reliability of the car. I often will help friends work on their cars, help them figure out what is wrong and researching a solution.</p>
